SDL hack
--------

SDL-1.2.15-hack.patch allows mpg123-with-SDL audio capture using AudioShark.

Put a patched copy of libSDL-1.2.so.0 in the current folder and execute,

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./AudioShark.py -l /usr/local/bin/mpg123 knock.mp3

SDL notes
---------

SDL_RunAudio in src/audio/SDL_audio.c and PULSE_WaitAudio in
src/audio/pulse/SDL_pulseaudio.c are interesting.

Win32 notes
-----------

Win32 stuff is currently unstable and crash prone. It is unlikely to improve.

Use https://github.com/kholia/wine/tree/SoundCore instead.
